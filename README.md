# Memory Game

### A Udacity Front-End Developer Nanodegree Program Project

This project is designed to demonstrate proficiency in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## How to play

Click on the cards to flip them over, revealing the icon underneath. Find two of the same icon
to make a match! Match all of the cards on the board to win.

### Scoring

Your score is reflected by the star rating system. This rating system is based solely on the
number of turns it takes you to win the game. Fewer turns results in a higher star rating.

## Dependencies

This project designed to use as few dependencies as possible. Playing the game is as simple
as cloning the repository and opening `index.html` in a modern browser.
